Project Overview
This project is a Python-based chatbot that provides video game recommendations based on user input. The chatbot uses a predefined set of intents and responses to understand and respond to queries about various game categories, such as multiplayer games, single-player games, co-op games, strategy games, RPG games, and sports games.

Features
Intent Recognition: The chatbot recognizes user intents using a simple classification approach based on predefined patterns and tags.
Game Recommendations: Provides recommendations for different types of games (e.g., multiplayer, single-player) based on user input.
Contextual Responses: Ensures varied and contextually appropriate game recommendations, avoiding repetition within a single session.
Easy to Extend: The project structure allows easy extension of the intents and responses to cover more game types or additional features.
